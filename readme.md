# The Daily Bugle

## Overview
The Daily Bugle is a Python project aimed at providing users with the latest news highlights by scraping the web, summarizing news articles using a large language model, and delivering the summaries via email or other mediums.

## Features
- Web scraping: The project scrapes various news websites to collect the latest news articles.
- Data preparation: The collected news articles are processed and prepared for summarization.
- Summarization: Utilizes a large language model to summarize the news articles into concise highlights.
- Delivery: Delivers the news highlights to users via email (and potentially other mediums in the future).

## How it Works
1. **Web Scraping**: The project utilizes Python's BeautifulSoup library to scrape news websites for the latest articles.
2. **Data Preparation**: Scraped articles are processed and formatted for input into a large language model.
3. **Summarization**: The prepared data is fed into a large language model (e.g., GPT-3) to generate summaries of the news articles.
4. **Delivery**: The generated news highlights are sent to users via email.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Mizan-Ali/the-daily-bugle.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to provide necessary inputs and receive news highlights.

## Future Improvements
- Addition of more news sources for broader coverage.
- Implementation of alternative delivery mediums (e.g., SMS, chatbot).
- Enhancement of summarization techniques for more accurate and informative summaries.
